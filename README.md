**[Now UI Kit - preview here](https://templates.pingendo.com/now-ui-kit/index.html)** is a responsive Bootstrap 4 kit designed by Invision and coded by Creative Tim and Pingendo. It is a beautiful cross-platform UI kit featuring over 50 elements and 3 templates.

Now UI Kit is one of the most popular UI Kits online, provided in PSD and Sketch formats by Invision and in HTML format by Creative Tim. We are now providing another HTML version, completely compatible with Pingendo editor.

Now will help you create a clean and simple website that is a perfect fit for today's flat design. It is built using the 12 column grid system, with components designed to fit together perfectly. It makes use of bold colours, beautiful typography, clear photography and spacious arrangements.

To get the PSD and Sketch files, please visit Invision (https://www.invisionapp.com/now).


**Bootstrap 4 Support**
Now UI Kit is built on top of the much awaited Bootstrap 4. This makes starting a new project very simple. It also provides benefits if you are already working on a Bootstrap 4 project; you can just import the Now UI Kit style over it. Most of the elements have been redesigned; but if you are using an element we have not touched, it will fall back to the Bootstrap default.

**Example Pages - coming soon!**
We wanted to fully display the power of this kit, so the kit comes packed with examples showing you how to use the components. They will be displayed in this repo as soon as they are done!
